Above is the profile page of trashbox, who is #1 player in LP ranking.

I'm trying to make some stats based on SFV CFN rankings because 2019 is about to end! For now, I looked into character usage of the top 10,000 players. It's so fun because I can see some unexpected facts!

Firstly, character usage of top 100 players.

## Character Usage (top 100 players)

By the way, #100 player is 215,402LP and it's twice of UGM. So this data are based on only super hardcore players.

Some can be trying the new character or subs as the timing is after updates though, Sim and F.A.N.G are surprisingly popular.

## Character Usage (top 10,000 players)

Next, the ranking of top 10,000 players. It seems to follow the performance this year, but looks like Ryu, Ken, Cammy and Chun-Li are so popular!
By the way, #9999 (two guys the same lp) is 20,505LP. So the top 10000 almost means more then SD.

I made it a chart.

![](chart.png)

Next time, I want to gather data on each profile page and make stats which is by areas, winrates, matches, and so on.

By knowing where we are in your character's ranking, how our winrate is high, or something, we might get motivated than now. Also, I wondered I can set your goal next year with it.ã€€Stay tuned!
