spoiler: with Gatsby and ZEIT now
---

Inspired by [Dan Abramov's blog](https://overreacted.io), I forked it and created my blog. I totally mimiced that one!

I really like this minimalistic design. Also, thanks to **GatsbyJS** which is a framework to build a website, it seems to be super easy to maintain articles and the blog system itself as well. So far so good ðŸ˜€

Technically speaking, I used to lean towards [react-static](https://github.com/react-static/react-static) rather than GatsbyJS though, my mind has somehow changed. The built-in **GraphQL** and plugins greatly help us customize a website for initial setup phase compared with react-static. Apart from that, I'm using **ZEIT now** which is a serverless deployment service like [netlify](https://www.netlify.com). This is awesome, too. I don't yet have enough experience to compare these tools, so would try out a number of functions going forward.

In this blog, I would write a post in both English and Japanese ðŸ’ª I stick to be independent on a blogging platform and set English as a default language here. I want to explain the reason in another post.
